        Hey Everyone! My name is Nicolette Angelotti and I am from Franklin Lakes, New Jersey. I am a double major studying Information Management & Technology in the iSchool and Communication and Rhetorical Studies in VPA. I am most interested in web design and creative writing. My academic accomplishments include becoming certified in excel and achieving the Success Scholar Award from SU. Outside of academics I value personal time, so I have learned to integrate meditation and relaxation into my daily routine. With that comes balance and I most definitely love to enjoy good food and good company. Spending quality time with family and friends is always a priority of mine. In my free time I love reading, listening to music, and traveling whenever the opportunity is given. At the moment I am reading “The Most Powerful Woman in the Room is You” By Lydia Fenet and my most recently played song on Apple Music was “August” by Taylor Swift. The last city I visited was Charleston, South Carolina where I got to try a ton of new food and appreciate beautiful new scenery! On a more personal note, My New Year’s resolution was to start saying “yes” more in order to become more open-minded and broaden my horizons!
