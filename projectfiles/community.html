        <h2>A Personal Piece</h2>
        <p>
            When is the last time you picked up the latest copy of “People” or “Us Weekly”? Now, when you really think about it- what are you reading about in these magazines that impacts you in the slightest? The answer is nothing! The average reader has no connection to the celebrities that are highlighted in these headlines. So, you have to ask yourself, “Why do I care?”. We have become so infatuated with celebrity lifestyle that reality television shows exist to simply keep us updated on their lives. I just find it ironic because these reality shows are not reality at all. The “news” that the media presents to us is not realistic either. So, what is the big deal about these celebrities? I understand, some dance, some sing, some write, but what about the celebrities that don’t have an established talent? Or, why do I even care about the minor details about these stars? After all, we have become so infatuated with their lifestyle that we stereotype most celebrities to lack knowledge, emotional depth, and other humane qualities. Americans love to place the power of monarchy in the hands of celebrities, but with the power and attention we give them, we often neglect the fact that they are real people.

There is a multitude of celebrities. Celebrities of all different talents seem to catch the media’s attention. Even the celebrities who seem to be in the limelight for a limited amount of time will come around and make headlines when they are spotted doing drugs or have a death in their family. The media is like a hawk circling around these celebrities waiting for something remotely news-worthy to be revealed. When the media finally latches onto a news story they can manipulate, then the hawk can be considered fed. What they do with this information they found is up to them. With a number of celebrities, there is a dedicated group of paparazzi where their only job is to locate their celebrity and take pictures of their everyday life. Why is this appealing to the average person? Why do we care that Jennifer Anniston was spotted entering a Starbucks south of Los Angles last Tuesday? That is absurd! These magazines and news sources feed consumers what they want to hear, and apparently what they want to hear is celebrities being “normal”. Why does the stigma around celebrities resonate with fans so easily? After watching movies, shows, concerts, or even commercials, most viewers feel as if they know this celebrity on more of a personal level. By fans making connections to these stars, they want to keep up with them as if they were a friend.

Each person has celebrities that they resonate with more than others. It is part of the media’s job to manipulate that in order to force readers to want to know about every celebrity. Headlines play a huge roll in getting people interested in celebrity life. Of course, you want to know who has been spotted on a date with Zach Efron and who is rumored to be pregnant. We subconsciously assign a stereotype to all the celebrities the media is infatuated with. We constantly fail to realize that these are genuine people with real emotion and real struggles.
These are real people. The only difference between us and celebrities is the fact they are always in the media. Every aspect of their personal life is revealed through a multitude of media platforms. The constant availability of the media forces us to see celebrities as characters that we read and hear about opposed to real, human, people. When Britney Spears had her iconic 2007 breakdown, the media presented her to the public as if she was a character from a horror movie. This young woman was obviously going through a period of psychological trauma and the public enjoyed and laughed at her pain. When Britney officially “went off the rails” and shaved her head, the media had a field day. How come when I get a haircut the Daily News doesn’t seem to care? This is all because the public has idolized and dehumanized celebrities and only uses them for entertainment with the help of the media. The media plays into the stereotyping of celebrities because often times when they are put in the media they are stripped of all basic human qualities. On this cover, we don’t see a bubbly and talented young woman. Instead we see a potentially drug-addicted and misguided young adult making an impulsive decision.

            In this infamous photo Britney is caught in the middle of shaving her head at a local salon in Los Angeles. In a documentary called “Britney off the Rails” the salon owner describes how she approached Britney’s breakdown. The owner took an empathetic approach toward having a celebrity in her small salon. She talks about how she tried to talk some sense into Britney as if she was a friend or daughter. At this point, Britney knew what she wanted and was not going to change her addenda. From there Britney picked up the razor and did the deed. I applaud the salon owner for being able to break the stereotype of celebrities. She was able to see past a single story and acknowledge the emotional trauma Britney was going through. If Britney was acting the way she was, and showing concerning signs of a breakdown, but she was no famous, her story would have ended a bit different in my opinion. The pressure from the public and paparazzi only magnified her struggles and made them worse. I know when I am having a bad day, the last thing I want is to publicize it. The reality if the situation is these are celebrities and every aspect of their lives are publicized for our entertainment.

            In Rosemarie Garland-Thomson’s `piece titled “The Politics of Staring: Visual Rhetoric of Disability in Popular Photography” she addresses how the media and propaganda manipulate and depict disability. I want to look closer at her analysis of a Victoria’s Secret ad. In the ad there is a model who has suffered from breast cancer and is embracing her scars. This radical image squashed the normalized male appropriation that is typically taken from ads like these. Victoria’s Secret and heir media team did not get a good response after the publication of the catalog. The public has no desire to see the reality of model’s lives, they simply want them to sit still and look pretty. Meanwhile on the other hand, the public wants to know the juicy secrets of celebrities like Britney Spears. I think the public was so astonished by the Victoria’ Secret model because they never expect a model to be flawed, but when celebrities’ flaws are revealed in the media, the public enjoys it since it is entertainment to them. When something is no longer entertaining, like the model’s amputated breast, than the public loses interest. This is a toxic attitude because it creates a stigma, especially around young girls to be perfect. Life is far from perfect and the media of all people should be able to embrace it. Viewers and publishers enjoy dehumanizing and stereotyping celebrities with the help of the media as a source of entertainment to them.

            As Americans we enjoy watching and observing the lives of celebrities, but we have to value and respect their lives as well. We place too much importance on things that have no relevance to us, and do not affect us in any way. I am not saying to stop loving your favorite actress or to stop following Justin Bieber on Instagram, but I am asking that we break the stereotype of celebrities and acknowledge them as real people with real struggles and flaws.
