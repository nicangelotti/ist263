            Girls supporting girls… through the good and bad.
            This website aims to create a safe space for women to embrace mental health, and create discussion involving the stigma around women who suffer from mental health issues. Whatever it is that you are going through, you are not alone. Confidence, class, and camaraderie.

               <li> Did you do anything that brought you personal joy?</li>
               <li> Did anyone contribute to your day and a negative way or a positive way?</li>
               <li> Do you feel like your emotions are valid? Remind her no one can tell you how to feel.</li>
               <li> Did you apologize for something that you didn’t do and wasn’t wrong?</li>
               <li> Are you confident in the person you were today? Or are you fatigued from putting on a façade?</li>
               <li> On a scale of 1 to 10, how content are you?</li>
